It is our hope that this message will reach you.

A transmission from the observation satellite a few hours ago informed us that you seemed to be wandering in a frighteningly uncoordinated manner. Your SatCom has ceased broadcasting. Your reactor seems to have suffered some sort of damage and your helmet was spotted at the bottom of a lake. If this is indeed the case, do not try to retrieve it, do not go into the water! Water on Tropica is highly toxic. You would not survive it.

Get back to your ship as quickly as possible and try to transmit information about the possible causes of this disaster. The satellite's information remains undecipherable. We have been speculating about an X-factor ever since the first expedition got lost. It appears you have just encountered it.

There is nothing we can really do to guide you but don't forget that you're following in the footsteps of a previous expedition. If what happened to you is what happened to them, chances are they may have left some clues along the way back to their own spaceship which landed in roughly the same area as yours. Use those clues.

You may also want to consider planting flags. They indicate the direction of the wind so you can use them to orient yourself.

This is all we can say for now...
Good Luck...

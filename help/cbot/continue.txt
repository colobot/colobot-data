With this instruction, you can jump over the rest of instructions in the \c;\l;bloc\u cbot\bloc;\n; of a \c;\l;while\u cbot\while;\n; or \c;\l;for\u cbot\for;\n; loop: The execution will resume at the beginning of the bloc, the next time the loop is repeated.
 
Here is an example:
\s;\c;int i = 0;
\s;while ( i < 5 )
\s;{
\s;	i = i+1;
\s;	if ( i == 3 )
\s;	{
\s;		continue;
\s;	}
\s;	\n;Instructions ...\c;
\s;}

The instructions will only be executed for the values of \c;i\n; 1, 2, 4 and 5.

\b;Instruction \c;do - while\n;
Syntax:
\s;\c;do
\s;{
\s;	\n;Instructions ...\c;
\s;}
\s;while ( condition );
\n;
This instruction allows you to perform several times the instructions inside the \l;block\u cbot\bloc;. The instructions are executed at least once, because the condition is tested only afterwards.
Be careful not to confuse the instruction \c;do { } while ( );\n; with the instruction \c;\l;while\u cbot\while; ( ) { }\n;; the latter tests the condition before the instructions in the block are executed. 

\t;\c;condition\n;
The instructions in the block are performed over and over again, as long as the \l;condition\u cbot\cond; is true. 

Here is an example :
\s;\c;do
\s;{
\s;	p = radar(TitaniumOre);
\s;}
\s;while ( p == null );
\n;
\t;Attention
Always put a \l;semicolon\u cbot\term; at the end of the line \c;while ( )\n;.

The instructions \c;\l;break\u cbot\break;\n; and \c;\l;continue\u cbot\continue;\n; can be useful inside a block following the instruction \c;do { }\n;.

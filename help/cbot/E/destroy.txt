\b;Instruction \c;destroy\n;
Syntax:
\s;\c;\l;object\u cbot\object;.destroy ( );\n;

Destroys an object.

\t;\l;object\u cbot\object;
\l;Destroyer\u object\destroy;.

\t;Return value: \c;\l;int\u cbot\int;\n;
Normally an error stops the program. You can prevent the program from stopping on errors by using the \c;\l;errmode\u cbot\errmode;(0)\n; instruction. A value different from zero if an error occurred is then returned by \c;destroy()\n;.
\c;== 0 \n;The operation of destroying an object was started
\c;!= 0 \n;The instruction could not be done (e.g. nothing to destroy)

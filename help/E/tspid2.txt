\b;Objective
Kill several spiders whose exact location we do not know. Use the bot's radar to find them.

\t;Program
Find the closest spider with the instruction \c;\l;radar\u cbot\radar;(AlienSpider);\n;, as we did it in the previous exercises with titanium ore and power cells. But do not go to the position of the spider, the bot would be destroyed before arriving there. Just turn towards the spider. The instruction \c;\l;direction\u cbot\direct;(item.position)\n; calculates the angle of the rotation that the robot must perform in order to aim at the spider. In order to actually aim at the spider, just write:
\c;
\s;	\l;turn\u cbot\turn;(\l;direction\u cbot\direct;(item.position));
\n;
Notice the two closing brackets at the end of the line, before the semicolon. There are two open brackets, so there must be two closing brackets.

Then shoot with the instruction \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;(1);\n;.

Here also, you can use a loop with \c;\l;while\u cbot\while; (true)\n; in order not to have to execute the program again for every spider, as we did in the last exercise.

\b;\button 164; Power Station
\image station 8 8;
The power station extracts energy from the underground and recharges \l;regular power cells\u object\power; through induction. To recharge a power cell loaded at the back of a bot, just move the bot to the center of the platform and wait a few seconds. A \l;power cell\u object\power; carried at arm's length can also be recharged. \l;Nuclear power cells\u object\atomic; are non-rechargeable.

A power plant needs some energy in the subsoil. If the satellite report says that energy is available only at some places, you will need a \l;sniffer bot\u object\botsr; to prospect the subsoil. The marks it lays down provide information about the specifics of its findings: a \l;green cross\u object\enerspot; means that there is an energy deposit at this location beneath the surface, which is indispensable to the construction of a power station or a \l;power plant\u object\energy;.

The large power cell at the top of the station remaining red after the construction is completed can only mean that the site is not geologically adequate.

\t;Requirements for building
Any flat and geologically adequate surface at least 6 meters wide.

\t;Input
Empty power cell.

\t;Output
Recharged power cell.

\t;Power source
Subsoil energy.

\t;Duration of operation
A few seconds, depending on the capacity to be recharged.

\image energy 8 8;
The power plant is a \l;power cell\u object\power; factory. It transforms a \l;titanium cube\u object\titan; into a regular power cell fully charged and ready for use.

A power plant requires some energy in the subsoil. If the satellite report says that energy is available only at some places, you will need a \l;sniffer bot\u object\botsr; to prospect the subsoil. The marks it lays down provide information about the specifics of its findings: a \l;green cross\u object\enerspot; means that there is an energy deposit at this location beneath the surface, which is indispensable for the construction of a power plant or a \l;power station\u object\station;.

If the large power cell at the base of the plant remains red after the construction is completed, this means that the site is not geologically adequate.

\t;Requirements for building
Any flat and geologically adequate surface of at least 4 meters wide.

\t;Input
Titanium.

\t;Output
Regular power cell.

\t;Power source
Subsoil energy.

\t;Duration of operation
12 seconds.

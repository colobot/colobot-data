\b;Colored Flag

The colored flags are helpful to mark strategic locations or positions that \l;you\u object\human; will need to find again. Flags appear on the mini-map in the shape of a cross of the same color as the flag.

Use the buttons \button 118; and \button 119; to plant and remove flags, the colors of which you can choose with the buttons above.

When your mini-map is out of order, the fact that flags follow the direction of the wind can help you to find your way and not to walk around in circles.

When programming, you can use flags to give a bot a reference to a certain position: the instruction \c;\l;radar\u cbot\radar;\n; allows bots to know the exact position of a flag of a given color.

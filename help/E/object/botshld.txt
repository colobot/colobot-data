\b;\button 157; Shielder
\image botshld 8 8;
Tracked bot designed to protect and defend against all \l;enemy\u object\mother; attacks within a perimeter of 10 to 25 meters. The individual shields of bots and buildings are re-energized through the shielder's defensive actions. This bot is the only way to get through narrow passages adorned with poisonous green mushrooms.

A \l;regular power cell\u object\power; allows for a 20-second activity span with a radius of 25 meters, much too short in most cases. A \l;nuclear power cell\u object\atomic; is of course more suited to this bot.

The energy consumption is proportional to the radius of the protective sphere. With a radius of 10 meters, the bot can work 2.5 times longer than with the maximum radius of 25 meters.

\t;Programming
To program the bot's movements, use the following commands : \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;, \c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n;, \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;.

To program the deployment of the shield, use \c;\l;shield\u cbot\shield;\n;.

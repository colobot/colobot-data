\b;\button 138; Tracked Grabber
\image botgc 8 8;
Tracked bot equipped with an operating arm.

\button 32; Grabs an object or lays it down again, at a position that is determined by one of the following options :
\button 33; The object is lying in front of the bot, on the ground or on the back of a second bot.
\button 35; The object is the bot's own power cell.
\button 34; The object is lying behind the bot, on the ground.

The following objects can be transported :
o  \l;Titanium ore\u object\titanore;.
o  \l;Uranium ore\u object\uranore;.
o  \l;Cube of titanium\u object\titan;.
o  \l;Regular power cell\u object\power;.
o  \l;Nuclear power cell\u object\atomic;.
o  \l;Black box\u object\bbox;.
o  \l;Keys A, B, C, and D\u object\key;.
o  \l;Organic matter\u object\bullet;.

Tracked bots can ascend steep inclinations but they are quite slow and use much energy. On flat ground for short distances, a \l;wheeled grabber\u object\botgr; is a better option. When it is possible to build \l;winged bots\u object\botgj;, these represent the best solution for long distances.

A grabber won't function underwater. What you'll need instead is a \l;subber\u object\botsub;.

\t;Programming
To program the bot's movements, use the following commands : \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;, \c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n;, \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;.

To program the operating arm, use \c;\l;grab\u cbot\grab;\n; and \c;\l;drop\u cbot\drop;\n;.

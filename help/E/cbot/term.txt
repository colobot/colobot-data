\b;Semicolon
Always use a semicolon \c;;\n; after a simple expression. For example: 
\c;
\s;	int counter = 0;
\n;
However, after a \l;bloc\u cbot\bloc;, never put a semicolon:
\c;
\s;	{
\s;		float dist;
\s;		dist = distance(p1, p2);
\s;	} \n;// no semicolon here!\c;
\n;
Do not use a semicolon either immediately after the instructions \c;\l;while\u cbot\while;\n;, \c;\l;if\u cbot\if;\n; or \c;\l;for\u cbot\for;\n;:
\c;
\s;	if ( a < b ) \n;// no semicolon here!\c;
\s;	{
\s;		b = 100-a;
\s;	}
\n;
An instruction is always ended by a semicolon, and not by the end of the line. So you can very well put several instructions on the same line: 
\c;
\s;	int d=20;
\s;	move(d);
\s;	turn(90);
\n;
Is equivalent to:
\c;
\s;	int d=20; move(d); turn(90);
\n;

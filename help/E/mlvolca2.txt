\b;Programs dispatched by Houston
We have developed a program that takes care of recharging the power cell of a \l;defense tower\u object\tower;:

1) Go to a \l;defense tower\u object\tower;.
2) Wait until the \l;power cell\u object\power; is 80% empty.
3) Grab the \l;power cell\u object\power; and recharge it on a \l;power station\u object\station;.
4) Put it back on the \l;defense tower\u object\tower;.

Build the \l;power station\u object\station; as close as possible to the tower in order to reduce the time when the tower has got no power cell. A good trick is to place a power cell on the ground in front of the tower. The wasp will attack the power cell, and if the first shoot misses or a wasp arrives when the defense tower has got no energy, only the power cell is destroyed and not the defense tower.

\image uranore 4 4;
Uranium ore is essential to the production of \l;nuclear power cells\u object\atomic;.

It is to be found on the surface or in the subsoil. In the latter case, it needs to be first located and identified by a \l;sniffer\u object\botsr;, then extracted using a \l;derrick\u object\derrick;. If a sniffer identifies a deposit of uranium ore, it lays down a \l;yellow circle\u object\uranspot;.

A \l;nuclear plant\u object\nuclear; will then take care of converting the chunk into a new and fully charged \l;nuclear power cell\u object\atomic;.

\t;Transport
All \l;grabbers\u object\botgr;. Due to its radioactivity, the \l;astronaut\u object\human; can not transport it.

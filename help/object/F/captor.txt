\b;\button 174; Power Captor
\image captor 8 8;
The power captor acts as both a lightning conductor and a power converter.
It offers protection within a radius of 50 meters against the perilous lightning bolts of magnetic storms. Additionally, when the captor is hit by lightning, all bots and \l;power cells\u object\power; placed underneath, with the exception of the \l;nuclear power cells\u object\atomic;, are recharged.

To visualize the zone shielded by a power captor, select it then hit the <range> button \button 41;. Red dots outline the circular zone for 20 seconds.

In the vastness of space, few planets suffer from magnetic storms. Among the ones you'll be visiting, only Orpheon is subject to this phenomenon.

Note that your \l;spaceship\u object\base; can also act as a lightning conductor. However it will not recharge power cells.

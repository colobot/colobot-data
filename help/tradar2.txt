\b;Exercise
In this exercise, a "crazy bot" places many \l;blue crosses\u object\waypoint; on the ground. In order to find them, you can reuse the program written in the previous exercise. This can show you the flexibility of such a program: it adapts to whatever environment it encounters.

\t;Remark
Do not wait too long, because the crazy bot gets down to work immediately. Fortunately, as long as you are in the program editor, the game will pause.

\b;Instruction \c;errmode\n;
The \c;errmode();\n; instruction allows you to chose if the program should stop when an error occurs in one of the following instructions: \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;, \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, \c;\l;grab\u cbot\grab;\n;, \c;\l;drop\u cbot\drop;\n;, etc.

\b;For specialists
Syntax¦:
\s;\c;errmode ( mode );\n;

Normally the program is stopped when an error occurs. If you use the instruction \c;errmode(0);\n; at the beginning of the program, the instructions listed above return a value different from zero if the instruction could not be performed.

\t;mode: \c;\l;float\u cbot\float;\n; (\c;1\n; per default)
Error treatment mode.
\c;0\n; -> continues program execution and returns a non zero value
\c;1\n; -> stops the program (default behavior)

Exemple 1¦:
\s;\c;errmode(0);
\s;while ( goto(pos) != 0 )
\s;{
\s;	wait(2);
\s;}
\n;
Exemple 2¦:
\s;\c;errmode(0);
\s;int err;
\s;err = goto(pos);
\s;if ( err != 0 )
\s;{
\s;	\n;goto did not perform correctly ...\c;
\s;	\n;take some appropriate action ...\c;
\s;}
\n;

\b;Instruction \c;aim\n;
Syntax :
\s;\c;aim ( angle );\n;

This instruction sets the vertical angle of the cannon. The following robots are equipped with a cannon: 
o  \l;Shooter\u object\botfr;
o  \l;Orga shooter\u object\botor;
o  \l;Phazer shooter\u object\botphaz;

When controlling the robot through programming, the only way to turn the gun left or right is to turn the whole robot with the instruction \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;.

\t;angle: \c;\l;float\u cbot\float;\n;
Angle in degrees of the gun relative to the robot. A positive value orients the gun upward. For shooters and orga shooters, the angle must range from \c;-20\n; to \c;+20\n; degrees. For phazer shooters, the angle must range from \c;-20\n; to \c;45\n; degrees.

\t;Return value: \c;\l;int\u cbot\int;\n;
Zero if everything is OK, a value different from zero if the rotation could not be performed: 
\c;== 0 \n;The gun has now got the desired orientation
\c;!= 0 \n;rotation impossible

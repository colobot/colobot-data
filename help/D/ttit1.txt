\b;Objective
Write a program that takes a chunk of \l;titanium ore\u object\titanore; and drops in on the \l;converter\u object\convert; in order to produce a \l;titanium cube\u object\titan;.

\t;Program
You will need a new instruction:
\c;
\s;move();\n;
Instructs the bot to move forward or backward. The distance of the move is given in brackets in meters: \c;move(10);\n; moves the bot 10m forward, \c;move(-1);\n; moves the bot 1m backward.

The instructions \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;()\n;, \c;\l;grab\u cbot\grab;()\n; and \c;\l;drop\u cbot\drop;()\n; have already been explained in the previous exercises. If you have any questions about these instructions, click the name of the instruction underlined in blue, and an explanation of the instruction will appear.

The \l;titanium ore\u object\titanore; is 20m in front of the bot, the \l;converter\u object\convert; is 10m behind the bot. After dropping the titanium ore on the converter, do not forget to move back (for example \c;move(-2.5);\n;) so as to allow the converter to get down to work.

\key;\key help;\norm; allows you to review these instructions at all times.

\b;\button 155; Winged Orga Shooter
\image botoj 8 8;
Jet propelled flying bot equipped with an orgaball cannon.

The orgaball cannon is more effective than the \l;fireball cannon\u object\botfj;. It shoots small spheres of corrosive \l;organic matter\u object\bullet;. A \l;regular power cell\u object\power; will allow you to shoot 11 orgaball bursts.

The display at the bottom of your screen indicates the temperature of the reactor. Keep an eye on it. If the reactor overheats, the engine will stop and the bot will crash.

Winged bots can fly across natural obstacles such as mountains or lakes but their energy supply is used up quickly. They're slow on the ground. To cover a short distance that will not call for flying, it is recommended to use a \l;wheeled orga shooter\u object\botor; instead.

\t;Programming
To program the bot's movements, use the following commands : \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;, \c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n;, \c;\l;jet\u cbot\jet;\n;, \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;.

To program the orgaball cannon, use \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;\n;. To raise or lower the aim, use \c;\l;aim\u cbot\aim;\n;.

\image botos 8 8;
Ant-legged creeping bot equipped with an orgaball cannon.

The orgaball cannon is more effective than the \l;fireball cannon\u object\botfs;. It shoots small spheres of corrosive \l;organic matter\u object\bullet;. A \l;regular power cell\u object\power; will allow you to shoot 11 orgaball bursts.

A moving legged orga shooter uses up half as much energy as a \l;wheeled orga shooter\u object\botor;. A legged bot is also perfectly adapted to climb the steepest slopes.

\t;Programming
To program the bot's movements, use the following commands : \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;, \c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n;, \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;.

To program the orgaball cannon, use \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;\n;. To raise or lower the aim, use \c;\l;aim\u cbot\aim;\n;.

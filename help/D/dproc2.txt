\b;Function
You will have noticed that the way is made of "L"-shaped parts that are fit one into another. The first one (dark blue) measures two times 25 meters. The second one (light blue) measures 5 meters less. Let us start with writing the \l;function\u cbot\function; that will move the bot on a "L"-shaped part whose length will be given as a parameter.

\b;Useful instructions
\c;\l;for\u cbot\for;\n; loop to repeat some instructions
\c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n; to move the bot
\c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; to turn the bot

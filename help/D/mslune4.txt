\b;Walkthrough
1) Build a converter \button 162; with the only titanium cube available.

2) Deposit one chunk of titanium ore at a time at the center of the platform and let the converter do the rest.

3) Build a power station \button 164; with one of the newly converted titanium cubes.

4) If you don't feel like looking for the black box yourself, build a radar \button 168; and the box will appear on your mini map somewhere north of your present location, at the bottom of a crater, next to a few derelict spacecraft and debris from the previous expedition.

5) Place the grabbers at the center of the power station platform to recharge them. The cells should still have a little power left in them, just enough to radio-control the bots onto the platform.

6) Radio-control the winged grabber to the black box and back.

7) Gather both grabbers and the black box onto the spaceship platform and climb on board yourself.

8) Take off.

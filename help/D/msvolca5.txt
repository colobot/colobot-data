\b;Walkthrough
Everything is blowing up around you. You need to leave the old basecamp as quickly as possible. Just retreat the same way you came.

\l;Ants\u object\ant; are fairly easy to avoid. If you're badly hit, find a quiet spot and wait until your shield has regenerated.

\l;Spiders\u object\spider; are a bit tougher but also more stupid. As soon as they see you, they burst their abdomen, dying in the process. If one fragment hits you, you'll die too. One risky but efficient method to rid yourself of a spider consists in moving dangerously close and, when the spider's abdomen starts inflating, swiftly fly backwards to safety.

As soon as you have reached a quiet island, you can use the \l;winged orga shooter\u object\botoj; to clear your way of hostile insects. Be careful not to lose it, otherwise the whole mission would be in vain.

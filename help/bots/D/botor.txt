\b;\button 153; Wheeled Orga Shooter
\image botor 8 8;
Wheeled bot equipped with an orgaball cannon.

The orgaball cannon is more effective than the \l;fireball cannon\u object\botfr;. It shoots small spheres of corrosive \l;organic matter\u object\bullet;. A \l;regular power cell\u object\power; will allow you to shoot 11 orgaball bursts.

Wheels constitute a standard, fast and energy-saving mode of propulsion, which is perfectly adapted for a relatively flat terrain. Whenever the terrain gets sloped, it is advised to instead use a \l;winged orga shooter\u object\botoj;, or, if this is impossible, a \l;tracked orga shooter\u object\botoc;.

\t;Programming
To program the bot's movements, use the following commands : \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;, \c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n;, \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;.

To program the orgaball cannon, use \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;\n;. To raise or lower the aim, use \c;\l;aim\u cbot\aim;\n;.

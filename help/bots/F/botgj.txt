\b;\button 139; Winged Grabber
\image botgj 8 8;
Jet propelled flying bot equipped with an operating arm.

\button 32; Grabs an object or lays it down again, at a position that is determined by one of the following options :
\button 33; The object is lying in front of the bot, on the ground or on the back of a second bot.
\button 35; The object is the bot's own power cell.
\button 34; The object is lying behind the bot, on the ground.

The following objects can be transported :
o  \l;Titanium ore\u object\titanore;.
o  \l;Uranium ore\u object\uranore;.
o  \l;Cube of titanium\u object\titan;.
o  \l;Regular power cell\u object\power;.
o  \l;Nuclear power cell\u object\atomic;.
o  \l;Black box\u object\bbox;.
o  \l;Keys A, B, C, and D\u object\key;.
o  \l;Organic matter\u object\bullet;.

The display at the bottom of your screen indicates the temperature of the reactor. Keep an eye on it. If the reactor overheats, the engine will stop and the bot will crash.

Winged bots can fly across natural obstacles such as mountains or lakes but their energy supply is used up quickly. They're slow on the ground. To cover a short distance that will not call for flying, it is recommended to use a \l;wheeled grabber\u object\botgr; instead.

A grabber won't function underwater. What you'll need instead is a \l;subber\u object\botsub;.

\t;Programming
To program the bot's movements, use the following commands : \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;, \c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n;, \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;.

To program the operating arm, use \c;\l;grab\u cbot\grab;\n; and \c;\l;drop\u cbot\drop;\n;.

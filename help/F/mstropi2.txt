\b;Walkthrough
Here is a breakdown of the steps to follow to get back to the spaceship.

1) Go round the lake, and head towards the green fluorescent globe. This globe is generated by a gravi-plant that will make flight impossible inside the globe.

2) Follow the left flank of the valley, passing a pond on your right, and climb the small slope. On top you will be facing some giant ants: run as fast as you can towards another gravi-plant a little further on your right, your wounds will have time to heal later.

3) Use your reactor to fly past the lake before the gravi-plant on your right.

4) When you leave the gravi-plant, keep on the left-hand side of the lake, and follow the shore until you reach a peninsula adorned with fern-like plants.

5) Do some island-hopping across the larger lake. Aim for the trees in order to avoid falling into the water on the other side of the island. The last island is 50 cm under water but you can still land on it without having your head submerged. 

6) The path continues to the left. A giant ant is waiting for you there, but it will not do you much harm.

7) Give your reactor enough time to cool down, then fly across the small lake. Try to land as high on the right as you can, this is the best way not to fall into the second lake.

8) Cross the second lake, get aboard the spaceship, and take off.

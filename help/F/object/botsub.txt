\b;\button 149; Subber
\image botsub 8 8;
Amphibious tracked bot equipped with an operating claw. The subber is the only bot capable of moving and running operations underwater.

It is best to check the \l;power cell\u object\power; readings prior to immersion since replacing or recharging it underwater is impossible. The subber can only pick up objects from the ground, as opposed to, for example, a battery from the back of another bot.

\t;Programming
To program the bot's movements, use the following commands : \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;, \c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n;, \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;.

To program the operating claw, use \c;\l;grab\u cbot\grab;\n; and \c;\l;drop\u cbot\drop;\n;.

\b;\button 141; Tracked Sniffer
\image botsc 8 8;
Tracked bot equipped to prospect the geological structure of the subsoil. Whenever it locates something of use, the sniffer lays down the following marks:

- a \l;red cross\u object\stonspot;       -> \l;titanium ore\u object\titanore;.
- a \l;yellow circle\u object\uranspot;  -> \l;uranium ore\u object\uranore;.
- a \l;green cross\u object\enerspot;   -> energy deposit, useful for a \l;power station\u object\station; or a \l;power plant\u object\energy;.

Tracked bots can ascend steep inclinations but they are quite slow and use a lot of energy. On flat ground for short distances, a \l;wheeled sniffer\u object\botsr; is a better option. When it is possible to build \l;winged bots\u object\botsj;, these represent the best solution for long distances.

\t;Programming
To program the bot's movements, use the following commands : \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;, \c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n;, \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;.

To program the sniffing arm, use \c;\l;sniff\u cbot\sniff;\n;.

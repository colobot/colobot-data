\b;Objectif
Program a \l;winged shooter\u object\botfj; to hunt all ants in the region.

\t;Program
In this swamp, a wheeled or tracked shooter is of little use. And ants, in opposition to spiders, keep moving: you can not just turn towards the closest ant, move forward and shoot.

The easiest way to solve the problem consists in flying at a height of 10 meters, aiming downward with \c;aim(-20);\n;, and approaching the ant with a conditional loop as long as the \l;distance\u cbot\dist; is greater than 20m. In this conditional loop, you must look for the closest ant, turn towards it, set the motors at full speed with \c;motor(1,1);\n;, and wait a little, for example 0.2 seconds. All these instructions must be repeated until the ant is at less than 20 meters. Then just shoot it.

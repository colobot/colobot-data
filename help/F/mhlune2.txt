\b;From Mission Control
This apparatus was set up by the previous expedition to test and train the flying capacity of winged bots.

\b;Objective
Use these drills to your advantage. Your ability to survive future critical situations may depend upon the dexterity they will have helped you develop.

\b;Procedure
Fly as quickly as possible through each target. Try to accomplish this without causing the engine to overheat. If this appears too difficult, just touch down and let the engine cool off.

You should use the arrow keys on the keyboard to pilot the bot, but keep one hand on the mouse. The mouse is useless in this exercise, but will be essential in later missions.

It may be useful to come back to these drills once in a while if you wish to improve your reflexes further.

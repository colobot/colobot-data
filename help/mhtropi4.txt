\b;From Mission Control
This is another training course set up by your predecessors and intended this time to test and train the firing capacity of \l;winged bots\u object\botfj;. Use it to familiarize yourself with the two simultaneous actions of shooting while flying.

Fly quickly through all targets and shoot all 10 explosive devices scattered along the way. Try to complete the drill without touching down. Watch your reactor though: if it overheats, just settle the bot and let it cool off.

Use one hand on the keyboard to pilot the bot, and the other hand on the mouse to aim and to shoot (left button).

It may be useful to come back to these drills once in a while if you wish to improve your reflexes further.

\key;\key help;\norm; allows you to review these instructions at all times on your personal SatCom \button 63;.

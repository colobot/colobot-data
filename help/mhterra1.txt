\b;From Mission Control
We've just received information that the first expedition designed a brand new weapon to be used on Terranova. It was safely stored away from possible enemy reach, inside a \l;vault\u object\safe; which can be accessed only by using four \l;keys\u object\key;. The keys are scattered on or under the planet surface.

The observation satellite has located one of these keys (A) north of your present position.

In compliance with Congress directives, our engineers have developed yet another strictly "defensive" bot : it is called a \l;shielder\u object\botshld; and it will offer adequate protection within a given perimeter. The data have been transmitted to your \l;research center\u object\research; along with a couple of relevant programs.

As you may know, uranium ore in the subsoil is a powerful fertilizer, furthering the growth of a variety of mushrooms. Please also note that \l;titanium ore\u object\titanore; is often located at the bottom of lakes on this planet.

When your mission is completed and before taking off, bring both a \l;shielder\u object\botshld; and a \l;subber\u object\botsub; aboard your spaceship.

\key;\key help;\norm; allows you to review these instructions at all times on your personal SatCom \button 63;.

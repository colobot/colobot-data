For example <c/>radar(AlienAnt,0,360,0,40);<n/> will only look for ants that are closer than 40 meters. The two first numbers tell the radar to search in all directions, the two last numbers tell the radar to detect only ants that are at a distance between 0 and 40 meters. If no ant is found that is closer than 40 meters, the instruction <code><a cbot|radar()>radar</a></code> returns the value <code>null</code>. We can then write a conditional loop similar to the one written in the last exercise that waits as long as there is no ant closer than 40 meters:"

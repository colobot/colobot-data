"When you are radio-guiding a bot, you can rotate the cannon during the burst "
"in order to sweep a whole zone. You can also do this when programming the "
"bot, but you have to turn the whole bot with the instruction <code><a "
"cbot|motor>motor</a>( , )</code>. This instruction asks for two numbers: the "
"speed of the left-hand motor, and the speed of the right-hand motor. These "
"numbers must range between -1 and +1.<c/> motor(1,1);<n/> moves the bot "
"forward with maximum speed (both motors at full power).<c/> "
"motor(-1,-1);<n/> moves the bot backward with maximum speed.<c/> "
"motor(1,0.9);<n/> moves the bot forward with a slight turn to the right: the "
"left-hand motor turns a little faster than the right-hand motor. And "
"<c/>motor(1,-1);<n/> will turn the bot clockwise on the spot: the left-hand "
"motor moves forward, the right-hand motor moves backward."

"Remote control a slave robot without using an <a object|exchange>information "
"exchange post</a>. The robot should pass over the 6 blue crosses. You must "
"use a <a cbot|string>string</a> to pass the orders to the slave bot. This "

"<code>\"move(20)\"</code>. You can see that this is the same syntax as used "
"in the CBOT language but we could have chosen any other syntax for exemple "
"something like <code>\"advance=20\"</code>. The string will be a <code><a "
"cbot|static>static</a></code> class member that will be used to communicate "

"The easiest way to solve the problem consists in flying at a height of 10 "
"meters, aiming downward with <c/>aim(-20);<n/>, and approaching the ant with "
"a conditional loop as long as the <a cbot|dist>distance</a> is greater than "
"20m. In this conditional loop, you must look for the closest ant, turn "
"towards it, set the motors at full speed with <c/>motor(1,1);<n/>, and wait "
"a little, for example 0.2 seconds. All these instructions must be repeated "
"until the ant is at less than 20 meters. Then just shoot it."

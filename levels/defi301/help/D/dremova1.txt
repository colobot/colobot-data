\b;Exercise
Convert some \l;titanium ore\u object\titanore; to \l;titanium cubes\u object\titan;, then drop 2 titanium cubes on the pads whose coordinates are:
\c;
	x=10, y=-60
	x=10, y=-65
\n;
\image derrick 8 8;
The \l;derrick\u object\derrick; extracts titanium ore from the subsoil; you just have to pick it up.

\image convert 8 8;
The \l;converter\u object\convert; converts titanium ore to titanium cubes. Just drop the titanium ore on the platform, move backward, and wait until it has been converted.

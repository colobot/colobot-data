\b;From Mission Control
We have determined that the best spot to build a \l;radar\u object\radar; on this planet is located on the highest mountain in this region. Unfortunately it is already occupied by a \l;ruined radar\u object\ruin;.

Build an \l;autolab\u object\labo; and use it to analyze the \l;explosive device\u object\tnt; you acquired, this will allow your \l;bot factory\u object\factory; to replicate the \l;target bot\u object\bottarg; designed by the previous expedition.

Use the target bot to dispose of the ruin, build a new radar in its place and take off.

\key;\key help;\norm; allows you to review these instructions at all times on your personal SatCom \button 63;.

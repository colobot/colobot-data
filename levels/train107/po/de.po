"The question is just how many meters the bot must move. The instruction "
"<code><a cbot|dist>distance</a>( , )</code> calculates the distance between "
"two positions. In this case, we need to know the distance between the bot "
"and the target. The position of the target is given by "
"<code>item.position</code>, the position of the bot is give by "
"<code>position</code>. The distance between the bot and the target is given "
"by <code><a cbot|dist>distance</a>(position, item.position)</code>. The "
"range of a fireball cannon is 40 meters. In order to get close enough, the "
"bot must move forward <code><a cbot|dist>distance</a>(position, "
"item.position)-40</code> meters. The following line will do this:"

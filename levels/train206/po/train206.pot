"In order to adapt the program to shooting wasps, you need to make a few "
"changes. Replace all <code>radar(AlienAnt)</code> with "
"<code>radar(AlienWasp)</code>. The cannon must aim straight forward and not "
"downward, replace <c/>aim(-20);<n/> with <c/>aim(0);<n/>. And the bot must "
"fly at the same height as the wasp. For this, you must compare the altitude "
"of the bot given by <code>position.z</code> with the altitude of the wasp "
"given by <code>item.position.z</code>: if <code>position.z > "
"item.position.z</code>, go down slowly with <c/>jet(-0.3);<n/>. If "
"<code>position.z < item.position.z-1</code>, climb slowly with "
"<c/>jet(0.3);<n/>. A winged shooter is higher than a wasp, therefore it is "
"better if the altitude of the bot is a little lower than the altitude of the "
"wasp. In this case, we admit that the altitude of the bot ranges between the "
"altitude of the wasp and the altitude of the wasp minus 1."

The two first numbers tell the radar to search in all directions, the two last numbers tell the radar to detect only ants that are at a distance between 0 and 40 meters. If no ant is found that is closer than 40 meters, the instruction <code><a cbot|radar()>radar</a></code> returns the value <code>null</code>. We can then write a conditional loop similar to the one written in the last exercise that waits as long as there is no ant closer than 40 meters:"

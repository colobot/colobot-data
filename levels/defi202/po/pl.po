"You must follow the <a object|bottr>target bot</a> with the explosive "
"device, but without touching it, otherwise it will blow up. Every time the "
"target bot stops, you must be close to it (less than 10m). After you managed "
"to stay close to the target bot at 10 successive stops, it will lead you to "
"the finishing pad, and the exercise is over. At every stop, the target bot "
"checks that you are there. If you are not there, you must start over again."

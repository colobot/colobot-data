Tracked bots can ascend steep inclinations but they are quite slow and use a lot of energy. On flat ground for short distances, a \l;wheeled builder\u object\botbr; is a better option. When it is possible to build \l;winged bots\u object\botbj;, these represent the best solution for long distances.

\t;Programming
To program the bot's movements, use the following commands : \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;, \c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n;, \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;.

To program the neutron gun, use \c;\l;build\u cbot\build;\n;.

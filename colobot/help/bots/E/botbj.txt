Winged bots can fly across natural obstacles such as mountains or lakes but their energy supply is used up quickly. They're slow on the ground. To cover a short distance that will not call for flying, it is recommended to use a \l;wheeled builder\u object\botbr; instead.

\t;Programming
To program the bot's movements, use the following commands : \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;, \c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n;, \c;\l;jet\u cbot\jet;\n;, \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;.

To program the neutron gun, use \c;\l;build\u cbot\build;\n;.

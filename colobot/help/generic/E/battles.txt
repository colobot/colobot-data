\b;Code battles
Code battle is a completely new game mode featured in Colobot: Gold Edition. The idea is that you set up two programs (yours and the opponent's) to fight with each other. The player can't interact with the world manually.

\b;How to control the level

\t;Starting a code battle
In order to start a code battle you need to:
1. Run all the necessary programs for your/all team(s).
2. Press the \button 21; button above the mini-map.

\t;Controlling the spectator's view
After a code battle is started, the camera is put into a special mode:
o One can select objects as a player normally would, but one will not see their interface and the camera does not rotate when the object rotates. One can also use numerical keyboard instead of mouse in order to rotate the object-centered camera.
o One can also switch to the free camera view by clicking somewhere on the map. One can move around in this view by using the numerical keyboard and \key;PageUp\norm;/\key;PageDown\norm; keys.
o One can return to the normal view by pressing the \button 13; button above the mini-map.

\b;Basics of production line\m production;
With the new functions provided in the Gold Edition, you can create a fully automatised base, which does not need any influence from \l;human\u object\human;. All of them are described in the \l;CBOT documentation\u cbot;.

Production line is explained in Missions and Exercises, but you may want to jump into code battles right away without beating the whole game. So here is a brief description of how the things works in Colobot.

\t;What you want to achieve
Basically, you want to destroy the opponent. To do that, you will need something lethal, for example, a robot, specifically, a \l;shooter\u object\botfr;. But you will probably be losing them quite often, so maybe you should keep the production going on. For example, more \l;grabbers\u object\botgr; or more \l;factories\u object\factory;, \l;converters\u object\convert; and so on would be helpful in that. Remember that robots needs \l;batteries\u object\power;. Anyway, before you can start, you must also do some \l;researches\u object\research; to get better technologies. And here we are at the beginning, with a single \l;robot\u object\botgr; and a \l;Titanium\u object\titan;.

\t;Titanium production
1. \l;Find\u cbot\radar; a \l;Titanium\u object\titan;.
2. \l;Build\u cbot\build; a \l;Converter\u object\convert;.
3. Find a \l;TitaniumOre\u object\titanore;.
4. Place it in the converter. Move back and wait until the converter is done.
5. Use or move somewhere your new Titanium.
Repeat steps 3-5 in order to keep your production going.

\t;Researches
1. \l;Build\u cbot\build; a \l;ResearchCenter\u object\research;.
2. Power it with a \l;PowerCell\u object\power;.
3. \l;Request\u cbot\research; a \l;research\u cbot\researches; and wait until the research center is done.

\t;Robot production
1. \l;Build\u cbot\build; a \l;BotFactory\u object\factory;.
2. Place a \l;Titanium\u object\titan; inside and move back.
3. \l;Request\u cbot\factory; a construction of a robot and wait until the bot factory is done.
4. Power the robot with a \l;PowerCell\u object\power;.

\t;Power cell production
1. \l;Build\u cbot\build; a \l;PowerPlant\u object\energy;.
2. Place a \l;Titanium\u object\titan; in it and wait until the power plant is done.

\t;There is more
There is much more options, but this is the basis. Read documentation, play the game and think creatively to come up with new ideas. Good luck and have fun!

\b;Instruction \c;trunc\n;
Syntax:
\s;\c;trunc ( value );\n;
Truncation is a method of approximating a decimal number by dropping all decimal places past a certain point without rounding. For positive numbers, it works like the \c;\l;floor();\u cbot\floor;\n; function, and for negative numbers, it works like the \c;\l;ceil();\u cbot\ceil;\n; function. It can be said that it rounds towards zero.

\t;value: \c;\l;float\u cbot\float;\n;
Number.

\t;Return value: \c;\l;float\u cbot\float;\n;
Truncated \c;value\n;. For example, \c;trunc(-2.5)\n; is \c;-2.00\n;.

\b;Instruction \c;radarall\n;
\c;radarall();\n; is an enhancement of the \c;\l;radar\u cbot\radar;();\n; function -- it detects all objects matching the given criteria.

\b;Example\c;
\s;object[] items = radarall(PowerCell);
\s;for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(items); ++i)
\s;{
\s;    message(items[i].id);
\s;}
\n;
\b;For specialists
\t;Syntax:
\s;\c;radarall ( cat, angle, focus, min, max, sens, filter );\n;

The function works generally the same as the \c;\l;radar\u cbot\radar;();\n; function with the only difference being that it returns an \l;array\u cbot\array; of \l;objects\u cbot\object; instead of one object. If no object is found, \c;\l;null\u cbot\null;\n; is returned.

The order of objects in the returned array is sorted by distance and depends on the \c;sens\n; parameter. The first object in the array is the object which would be returned by the \c;radar();\n; function called with the exactly same parameters.

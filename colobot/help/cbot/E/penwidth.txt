\b;Instruction \c;penwidth\n;
Syntax:
\s;\c;penwidth ( color );\n;
The instruction \c;penwidth();\n; instructs the bot to change the width of the pencil.

\t;width: \c;\l;float\u cbot\float;\n;
Width of the pen. The width cannot be higher than \c;1.0\n; and cannot be lower than \c;0.0\n;. Passing a higher value will result in the width being the highest possible and passing a lower value will result in the width being the lowest possible.

\t;Return value: \c;\l;int\u cbot\int;\n;
Normally an error stops the program. You can prevent the program from stopping on errors by using the \c;\l;errmode\u cbot\errmode;(0)\n; instruction. A value different from zero if an error occurred is then returned by \c;penwidth();\n;.
\c;== 0 \n;The width was changed
\c;!= 0 \n;The instruction did not work

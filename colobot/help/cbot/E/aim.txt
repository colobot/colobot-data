\b;Instruction \c;aim\n;
Syntax:
\s;\c;aim ( y, x );\n;

This instruction sets the vertical and the horizontal angle of the cannon. The following robots are equipped with a cannon: 
o  \l;Shooter\u object\botfr;
o  \l;Orga shooter\u object\botor;
o  \l;Phazer shooter\u object\botphaz;

When controlling the robot through programming, the gun can be also turned left or right by turning the whole robot with the instruction \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;.

\t;y: \c;\l;float\u cbot\float;\n;
Angle in degrees of the gun relative to the robot. A positive value orients the gun upward. For shooters and orga shooters, the angle must range from \c;-20\n; to \c;+20\n; degrees. For phazer shooters, the angle must range from \c;-20\n; to \c;45\n; degrees.

\t;x: \c;\l;float\u cbot\float;\n; (default value: \c;0\n;)
Angle in degrees of the gun relative to the robot. A positive value orients the gun to the right. The angle must range from \c;-40\n; to \c;+40\n; degrees for all shooters.

\t;Return value: \c;\l;int\u cbot\int;\n;
Zero if everything is OK, a value different from zero if the rotation could not be performed: 
\c;== 0 \n;The gun has now got the desired orientation
\c;!= 0 \n;rotation impossible

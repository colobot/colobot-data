\b;Keyword \c;protected\n;
This is an access modifier for \l;class\u cbot\class; members. Protected class members can be accessed in a child class, but they can't be accessed outside of classes definitions being part of the same inheritance tree (see the \c;\l;extends\u cbot\extends;\n; keyword).

\t;Example
\c;
\s;public class Parent
\s;{
\s;	protected int field = 0;
\s;}
\s;
\s;public class Child extends Parent
\s;{
\s;	void Print()
\s;	{
\s;		message(field);
\s;	}
\s;}
\s;
\s;extern void object::Test()
\s;{
\s;	Child child();
\s;	child.Print(); // 0
\s;	//child.field = 1; // Error!
\s;}
\n;

\b;Value \c;Research names\n;
Research names represent the types of available researches in the CBOT language. You can use them to control \l;ResearchCenter\u object\research; by passing them to appropriate instructions (e.g. \l;research\u cbot\research;, \l;canresearch\u cbot\canresearch;, \l;researched\u cbot\researched;).

In a program, research names are always displayed on a \const;red background\norm;. If a research name is not highlighted in red, it is misspelled. Caps and lower cases should be kept as is.

Below are the different research names available.

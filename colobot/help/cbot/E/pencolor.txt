\b;Instruction \c;pencolor\n;
Syntax:
\s;\c;pencolor ( color );\n;
The instruction \c;pencolor();\n; instructs the bot to change the color of the pencil.

\t;color: \c;\l;int\u cbot\int;\n; (default value: \c;Black\n;)
\l;Color name\u cbot\colors;.

\t;Return value: \c;\l;int\u cbot\int;\n;
Normally an error stops the program. You can prevent the program from stopping on errors by using the \c;\l;errmode\u cbot\errmode;(0)\n; instruction. A value different from zero if an error occurred is then returned by \c;pencolor();\n;.
\c;== 0 \n;The color was changed
\c;!= 0 \n;The instruction did not work

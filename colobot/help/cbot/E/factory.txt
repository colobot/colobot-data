\b;Instruction \c;factory\n;
Syntax:
\s;\c;\l;object\u cbot\object;.factory ( cat, program );\n;

Starts a construction of a bot of the given \l;category\u cbot\category; and runs the specified program on it after the construction is finished.

\t;\l;object\u cbot\object;
\l;BotFactory\u object\factory;

\t;cat: \c;\l;int\u cbot\int;\n;
\l;Category\u cbot\category; of the robot to construct.

\t;program: \c;\l;string\u cbot\string;\n; (default value: \c;""\n;)
Program that will be run on the bot after factory finishes the construction. This can be either a \l;public\u cbot\public; \l;function\u cbot\function;, a \l;filename\u cbot\file; or just a raw source code.

\t;Return value: \c;\l;int\u cbot\int;\n;
Normally an error stops the program. You can prevent the program from stopping on errors by using the \c;\l;errmode\u cbot\errmode;(0)\n; instruction. A value different from zero if an error occurred is then returned by \c;factory()\n;.
\c;== 0 \n;The construction successfully started
\c;!= 0 \n;The construction could not be started (e.g. no \l;Titanium\u object\titan; in the factory, the bot is not researched)

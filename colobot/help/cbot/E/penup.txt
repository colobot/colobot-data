\b;Instruction \c;penup\n;
Syntax:
\s;\c;penup ( );\n;
The instruction \c;penup();\n; instructs the bot to have the pen up, so it stops drawing. The pen is up by default, so it should be used only after using \c;\l;pendown\u cbot\pendown;\n;.

\t;Return value: \c;\l;int\u cbot\int;\n;
Normally an error stops the program. You can prevent the program from stopping on errors by using the \c;\l;errmode\u cbot\errmode;(0)\n; instruction. A value different from zero if an error occurred is then returned by \c;penup();\n;.
\c;== 0 \n;The pen is now up
\c;!= 0 \n;The instruction did not work

# Colobot Data Files

This repository contains the data files for the Colobot project (https://github.com/colobot/colobot).
It currently includes:
* mission files
* textures
* model files
* sounds and music
* ai scripts
* in-game help
* some documents describing the formats
* conversion scripts and tools for packaging

# Installation

CMake project files in main and data repositories are integrated and when invoked during compilation,
produce output files to be installed. As of 0.1.2-alpha, the generated files are different from source
files. Consequently, running the game with data files directly from this source repository is not supported.
Please see the [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/colobot/colobot/blob/master/INSTALL.md) instructions
in main repository for details.

Some details of how data file translation is achieved can be found in
[README.i18n.md](https://github.com/colobot/colobot-data/blob/master/README.i18n.md) file.
